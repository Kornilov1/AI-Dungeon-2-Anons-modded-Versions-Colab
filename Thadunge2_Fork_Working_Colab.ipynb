        "4. (Optional) Run the fifth cell if you want more RAM, the allocated GPU will crash (takes about 80-85 seconds) and Google Colab will offer you an option to get more RAM (max is 25GB), if you have already max RAM you can skip this.\n",

        "*If this cell gives you an error, try replacing the first cell with this parameters to install missing dependencies (only overwrite 'pip' parts, it might be possible that future updates to the GitHub fork require more dependencies) and run it, and it 'should' solve the problem:\n",

        "**Make sure each command is finished, some of them take a while to process.\n",
