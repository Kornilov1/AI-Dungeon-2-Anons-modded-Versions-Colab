        "AI Dungeon 2 is a completely AI generated text adventure built with OpenAI's largest GPT-2 model. It's a first of it's kind game that allows you to enter and will react to any action you can imagine.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a mod of the base game made entirely by the collective efforts of Anons, so you know what to expect from this.\n",

        "* [Read more](https://pcc.cs.byu.edu/2019/11/21/ai-dungeon-2-creating-infinitely-generated-text-adventures-with-deep-learning-language-models/) about how AI Dungeon 2 is made.\n",
        "\n",

BEWARE that there is no telling of if he will ever cuck out to pressure, but you can see for yourself [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/roadmap-32316007), also remember that he is a mormom IRL so you know what to expect.\n",
        " - It's official, the author is a confirmed hack that doesn't even know what the fuck is he doing: he trained the AI with bullshit it didn't even need, with the training data being badly formatted (which is where all the weird responses from the AI come from), on an Open Source software (GPT-2 model), and putting it online with some simple code anyone could write.\n",
        " - And now he begs for money on patreon, for costs he doesn't even have, to do something he is too retarded to do, and with promises to change shit he can't change. He is a scammer and doesn't deserve your money. If you already donated, try to pull out.\n",
        " - There are Anons currently trying to integrate the vanilla Open Source GPT-2 model with whatever works of the modded version of AI Dungeon 2. But, for the time being, we will have to do with this modded one. There is also the possibility of re-training the AI, but this option (while being looked for) is still too remote for now. \n",
        "* If you want to help, you can seed **[this torrent](https://github.com/nickwalton/AIDungeon/files/3935881/model_v5.torrent.zip)**, which contains the model that was generated to create the AI.\n",
        "* **[This file](https://www31.zippyshare.com/v/MmIhmh8P/file.html)** is supposedly an untrained GPT-2 instance that can be used instead, but any claims have yet to be supported. It could be useful for your own training, though, so use at your own risk.\n",
